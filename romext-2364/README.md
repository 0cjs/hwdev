romext-2364
===========

This board has a 2764 EPROM socket (typically) ZIF into which you plug your
own EPROMs, and a 2364 ROM socket that connects via a IDC cable to a 2364
ROM socket inside the machine, effectively "inserting" your 2764 EPROM into
the 2364 ROM socket. (The cable between the two allows you to have the
board outside the system case so that you can easily access it to change
EPROMS.)
