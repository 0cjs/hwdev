======================================

- [`drom`]: Ideas for a diode-ROM board.
- [`kp25tk`]: Configurable 25-key parallel keypad, with additional reset
  button and slide switch. The primary use is as a hex keypad interface to
  trainer boards, but it can serve a wide variety of purposes.
- [`rc6800`]: Variant of the RC6502 bus design, which is in turn a variant of
  the RC2014 bus.
- [`tk85`]: Projects for the NEC TK-85 trainer board.
