Floppy Head Protector
=====================

This project has no schematic, just a PCB. Use `pcbnew` to edit it.

This is a plain FR4 board (with no copper etc.) used as a template for
cutting out cardboard head protectors inserted into 5.25" floppy drives
during transport.

It's 2 mm smaller in each dimension than the actual cardboard used as a
design reference because the knife will cut about 1 mm away from the edge
of the template.

It uses sharp angles at the corners, but it may be better to fillet these.
