KP25TK To-do List
=================

Schematic:
- Note 1N5819 diode type in README. Also note that 1N4148 has lower
  junction capacitance and much lower leakage current?
- Consider changing KB matrix decoupling resistor to same as debounce
  for easier BOM. (Decoupling value not terribly important.)
- Peer Review
