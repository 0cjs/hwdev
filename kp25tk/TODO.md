KP25TK To-do List
=================

Schematic:
- Change 74LS14 for 74HC14 (or does it need HCT?). This makes sure that the
  NMI etc. outputs are CMOS-compatible.
- Peer Review
- Note 1N5819 diode type in README. Also note that 1N4148 has lower
  junction capacitance and much lower leakage current?

Board Layout:
- Add 6 holes for M3 screws for stand-offs: 4 at corners of keypad, 2 at top
- Draw traces
