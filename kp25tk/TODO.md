KP25TK To-do List
=================

Schematic:
- Remove all `SWnn` for key matrix switches on schematic and PCB;
  these will now be referred to only by `KEYnn` designations, so
  that we don't get switch numbers confused with scan codes.
- Add green LED for switch? (anode +5V, pulled down by 74LS14)

Board Layout:
- Add 6 holes for M3 screws for stand-offs: 4 at corners of keypad, 2 at top.
- Draw traces.
